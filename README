OpenCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler, which translates COBOL
programs to C code and compiles it using GCC.

This package contains the following subdirectories:

    cobc        COBOL compiler
    libcob      COBOL run-time library
    bin		COBOL driver program
    lib         static library and common headers
    config      configuration files
    po          international messages
    texi        Texinfo files
    tests       Test suite

All programs except those in lib and libcob are distributed under
the GNU General Public License.  See COPYING for details.

Programs in lib and libcob are distributed under the GNU Lesser
General Public License.  See COPYING.LIB for details.

See AUTHORS for the author of each file.

Requirements
============

OpenCOBOL requires the following external libraries to be installed:
(Note - all the following packages are normally part of a Linux
 distribution. Cygwin also has these as installable packages)

  o GNU MP (libgmp) 4.1.2 or later
    http://swox.com/gmp/

    libgmp is used to implement decimal arithmetic.

    GNU MP is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.

  o GNU Libtool (libltdl)
    http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html

    *** Note - libltdl is NOT needed when installing on Linux
        or Windows (including Cygwin and MingW) ***

    libltdl is used to implement dynamic CALL statements.

    GNU Libtool is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.

The following libraries are required when :

Indexed-Sequential file I/O is used or SORT/MERGE is used

  o Berkeley DB (libdb) 1.85 or later (runtime and development)
    http://www.sleepycat.com/
    Recommended is version 4.x as 1.85 is known to have problems.

    libdb is used to implement indexed file I/O and SORT/MERGE.

    Berkeley DB is distributed under the original BSD License (1.85)
    or their own open-source license (2.x or later).  Note that, as
    of 2.x, if you linked your software with Berkeley DB, you must
    distribute the source code of your software along with your
    software, or you have to pay royalty to Sleepycat Software, Inc.

SCREEN I/O is used or extended ACCEPT/DISPLAY is used
  o Ncurses (libncurses) 5.2 or later
    http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html

    libncurses is used to implement SCREEN SECTION and extended
    ACCEPT/DISPLAY.

    Ncurses is distributed under a BSD style license.

Installation
============

** NOTE **
Due to deficiencies in the tools used to prepare
OpenCOBOL (autoconf/automake/libtool), it is
NOT generally possible to use path names with
spaces embedded within them (Mainly Cygwin/MingW).
 
See INSTALL for general installation instruction.  Typically,
this is done by the following commands:

    ./configure
    make

Here you may run
    make check
to run a series of OpenCOBOL test programs

    make install

The "make install" will default to "/usr/local" as
the install path. You may override this by specifying
"--prefix=<your install path>" on the "./configure"
command.

There are the following configure options:

  --with-cc=<cc>		Specify C compiler command used by cobc
				Do not specify this unless you know what
				you are doing!

  --with-db1			Use Berkeley DB 1.85 (libdb1/libdb-1.85)
				This overrides --with-db/--without-db

  --with-db			Use Berkeley DB 3.0 or later (libdb)
				This is the default

  --without-db			Do not use Berkeley DB
				You will not be able to use SORT/indexed I/O

  --with-lfs64			Use large file system for file I/O
				This is the default

  --without-lfs64		Do not use large file system I/O

  --with-dl			Use the system dynamic linker instead of ltdl
				This is the default
				(Note on Windows, native loading is used)

  --without-dl			Use ltdl for dynamic program loading

  --with-patch-level=<n>	Set internal patch level to n (default 0)

  --with-varseq=<n>		Define the format for variable length sequential
				files. For these files, 4 bytes are written
				preceeding each record. The format of these 4
				bytes for values of <n> is as follows :
				n = 0 (default)
					The first 2 bytes are the record length
					in big-endian order. This is compatible
					with mainframe. Bytes 3 and 4 are set
					to binary 0.
				n = 1
					The 4 bytes are the record length in
					big-endian order.
				n = 2
					The 4 bytes are the record length in
					native machine order (int).
					(This was previously the default)

  --enable-debug		Add '-g' debug option to make


Development
===========

If you are a developer, consider building the latest OpenCOBOL
from the CVS repository.

You need to install the following extra packages with specified
minimum version before building OpenCOBOL:

For compiling :
  o Bison 1.875
  o Flex 2.5.4

If you reconfigure and/or prepare a distribution
  o Autoconf 2.59
  o Automake 1.9.6
  o Libtool 1.5.22
  o Gettext 0.14.1
  o Texinfo 4.6 (For makeinfo)

After checking out the latest source from the repository, you
are ready to run configure.
If you modify top-level configure.ac or Makefile.am in any directory,
then you will need to run "autoreconf -I m4" to regenerate the
necessary files.

You might want to run your configure script with option
--enable-maintainer-mode during development so that make
will automatically regenerate configure script and so on.
