Requirement
===========

OpenCOBOL requires the following external libraries to be installed:

  o GNU MP (libgmp) 3.1.1 or later
    http://swox.com/gmp/

    libgmp is used to implement decimal arithmetic.

    GNU MP is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.

  o GNU Libtool (libltdl)
    http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html

    libltdl is used to implement dynamic CALL statements.

    GNU Libtool is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.

  o Berkeley DB (libdb) 1.85 or later
    http://www.sleepycat.com/

    libdb is used to implement indexed file I/O.

    Berkeley DB is distributed under the "as is" basis.

  o Ncurses (libncurses) 5.2 or later [optional]
    http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html

    libncurses is used to implement SCREEN SECTION.

    Ncurses is distributed under the "as is" basis.

  o GNU Readline (libreadline) [optional]
    http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html

    Readline can be used for terminal input to implement
    ACCEPT statements.  You must give --with-readline
    option to the configure script to activate this.

    Note that Readline is distributed under GNU General Public 
    License (GPL), not Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
    You must distribute your COBOL programs under GNU GPL
    if you are going to link them with Readline.

Installation
============

Installing OpenCOBOL is typically done by the following commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

You can give the following options to the configure scripts:

    --with-readline     Link with libreadline

See INSTALL for general installation instruction.

Development
===========

If you are a developer, consider building the latest OpenCOBOL
from the CVS repository.

You need to install the following extra packages before building
OpenCOBOL:

  o Autoconf 2.57
  o Automake 1.7.2
  o Libtool 1.4.3
  o gettext 0.11.5
  o Bison 1.35
  o Flex 2.5.4

After checking out the latest source from the repository, run
"autoreconf -i" to generate configure script.  You need to run
autoreconf whenever you modify configure.ac or Makefile.am.

You might want to run your configure script with option
--enable-maintainer-mode during development so that make
will automatically regenerate configure script and so on.
