OpenCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler, which translates COBOL
programs to C code and compiles it using GCC.

This package contains the following subdirectories:

  cobc          COBOL compiler
  cobpp         COBOL preprocessor
  libcob        COBOL run-time library
  lib           static library and common headers
  po            localization files
  texi          Texinfo files
  testsuite     Test suite

OpenCOBOL requires the following external libraries to be installed:

  o GNU MP 3.1.1 or later
    http://swox.com/gmp/

    libgmp is used to implement decimal arithmetic.

  o GNU Libtool (libltdl)
    http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html

    libltdl is used to implement dynamic CALL statements.

  o Berkeley DB 2.0 or later
    http://www.sleepycat.com/

    libdb is used to implement indexed file I/O.

  o GNU Readline (optional)
    http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/~chet/readline/rltop.html

    Readline can be used for terminal input to implement
    ACCEPT statements.  You must give --with-readline
    option to the configure script to activate this.

    Note that Readline is distributed under GPL, not LGPL,
    so you must distribute your COBOL programs under GPL
    if you are going to link them with Readline.

See INSTALL for general installation instruction.
Generally, this must be done by the following commands:

  ./configure
  make install

See HACKING for some developer's note.
