OpenCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler, which translates COBOL
programs to C code and compiles it using GCC.

This package contains the following subdirectories:

    cobc        COBOL compiler
    libcob      COBOL run-time library
    bin		COBOL driver program
    lib         static library and common headers
    config      configuration files
    po          international messages
    texi        Texinfo files
    tests       Test suite

Requirement
===========

OpenCOBOL requires the following external libraries to be installed:

  o GNU MP (libgmp) 4.1.2 or later
    http://swox.com/gmp/

    libgmp is used to implement decimal arithmetic.

    GNU MP is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.

  o GNU Libtool (libltdl)
    http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html

    *** Note - libltdl is NOT needed when installing on Linux
        or Cygwin ***

    libltdl is used to implement dynamic CALL statements.

    GNU Libtool is distributed under GNU Lesser General Public License.

The following libraries are optional:

  o Berkeley DB (libdb) 1.85 or later
    http://www.sleepycat.com/

    libdb can be used to implement indexed file I/O and SORT/MERGE.

    Berkeley DB is distributed under the original BSD License (1.85)
    or their own open-source license (2.x or later).  Note that, as
    of 2.x, if you linked your software with Berkeley DB, you must
    distribute the source code of your software along with your
    software, or you have to pay royalty to Sleepycat Software, Inc.

  o Ncurses (libncurses) 5.2 or later
    http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html

    libncurses can be used to implement SCREEN SECTION.

    Ncurses is distributed under a BSD style license.

Installation
============

See INSTALL for general installation instruction.  Typically,
this is done by the following commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

There are the following configure options:

  --with-cc=<cc>		specify C compiler command used by cobc

  --with-db1			use Berkeley DB 1.85 (libdb-1.85)
				This overrides --with-db/--without-db

  --with-db			use Berkeley DB 3.0 or later (libdb)
				This is the default

  --without-db			Do not use Berkeley DB
				You will not be able to use SORT/indexed I/O

  --with-lfs64			use large file system for file I/O
				This is the default

  --without-lfs64		Do not use large file system I/O

  --with-dl			use the system dynamic linker instead of ltdl
				This is the default on Linux/Cygwin

  --with-patch-level=<n>	Set internal patch level to n

Development
===========

If you are a developer, consider building the latest OpenCOBOL
from the CVS repository.

You need to install the following extra packages with specified
minumum version before building OpenCOBOL:

  o Autoconf 2.59
  o Automake 1.8
  o Libtool 1.5.2
  o Gettext 0.14.1
  o Bison 1.875
  o Flex 2.5.4

After checking out the latest source from the repository, run
"autoreconf -i -I m4" to generate configure script.  You need to run
autoreconf whenever you modify configure.ac or Makefile.am.

You might want to run your configure script with option
--enable-maintainer-mode during development so that make
will automatically regenerate configure script and so on.
