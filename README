Installation
============

Installing OpenCOBOL is typically done by the following commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

See INSTALL for general installation instruction.

Development
===========

If you are a developer, consider building the latest OpenCOBOL
from the CVS repository.

You need to install the following extra packages before building
OpenCOBOL:

  o Autoconf 2.57
  o Automake 1.7.3
  o Libtool 1.5
  o Gettext 0.12.1
  o Bison 1.35
  o Flex 2.5.4

After checking out the latest source from the repository, run
"autoreconf -i" to generate configure script.  You need to run
autoreconf whenever you modify configure.ac or Makefile.am.

You might want to run your configure script with option
--enable-maintainer-mode during development so that make
will automatically regenerate configure script and so on.
