	* Initial checkout
	* cobcrun.c, Makefile.am, Makefile.in
	* syntax : cobcrun MYPROG [ arguments to MYPROG]
	* This allows complete applications to be compiled
	  as modules and offers similar functionality to
	  MF's cobrun and ACU's runcbl.
	  In fact, you can run all three in the same
	  directory and, if your scripts use an environment
	  variable for the driver program (eg. $COBEXEC),
	  then you can switch easily.
