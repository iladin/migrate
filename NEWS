only without any output.

in the output.

** New compiler option `-fline-directive', which includes line directive
in the output.

** New compiler option `-fruntime-inlining', which is the replacement
of obsolete options `-finline-move' and `-finline-get-int'.

** New compiler option `-w', which inhibits warnings.

** The compiler option `-column' removed.

** SHARING clause has been implemented.

** LENGTH OF phrase has been implemented.

** Many bug fixes.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.23

** Installation changes

*** We use the GNU MP library again.

** Run-time library changes

*** `cob_resolve' now search the main program for the module name.

** Bug fixes

*** Duplicate use of intermediate field variables.

*** fseek issues on the MinGW environment.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.22

** Installation changes

*** We no longer depend on the GNU MP library.

Decimal arithmetic is done by using `long long'.

** Compiler changes

*** Alphabet-name has been implemented.

*** Variable-length table has been implemented.

*** De-editing (move numeric-edited to numeric) has been implemented.

** Bug fixes


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.21

** Installation changes

*** New configure argument --with-lfs64.

** Compiler changes

*** New option -std, which specifies which COBOL standard to use.

Currently the following standards are available:

  gnu           GNU COBOL (default)
  cobol85       COBOL 85
  cobol2002     COBOL 2002
  mvs           IBM COBOL for MVS & VM

*** New option -O, which enables some optimization.

*** New option -debug, which enables run-time error checking.

*** New option -Wobsolete, which reports obsolete features.

*** New option -Warchaic, which reports archaic features.

*** -Wnext-sentence has been removed.  Use -Warchaic instead.

*** -fdebugging-line has been removed.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.20

** cobpp has been integrated into cobc.

Now cobc is the only binary program.

** cobc now generates an executable without `-main' flag.

`-main' has been renamed to `-fmain', which is turned on
by default if none of -E, -C, -S, -c, or -m is given.

** The default source format is now the fixed form.

The format will not be detected automatically.  You need
to use SOURCE FORMAT compiler directive as described below.
This conforms to the COBOL 2002 standard.

** Compiler directive "SOURCE FORMAT" is now supported.

Put the following line at the beginning of file if you
want to use the free-form:

  >>SOURCE FORMAT IS FREE

** Option `-semi-fixed' has been removed.

If you want to expand the program text area over 72 columns,
use the option `-column' instead.

** New option `-column', which specifies the end of program text area.

** New option `-T', which specifies the tab width.

** New warning options:

  -Wall                 Enable all warnings
  -Wcolumn-overflow     Warn any text after column 72
  -Wconstant            Warn inconsistent constant
  -Wparentheses         Warn lacks of parentheses around AND within OR
  -Wnext-sentence       Warn uses of NEXT SENTENCE
  -Wimplicit-terminator Warn lacks of scope terminator (END-XXX)
  -Wstrict-typing       Warn type mismatch strictly

** Option `debug' has been renamed to `-fdebugging-line'.

** USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL is now supported.

** Improved error checking.

** Additional testsuite entries.

** Bug fixes.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.12

** Improved compile-time error check.

** Additional testsuite entries.

** Bug fixes.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.11

** Part of run-time library interface has been redesigned.

** Bug fixes.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.10

** Autoconf 2.57, Automake 1.7.2, Libtool 1.4.3, and Gettext 0.11.5
are used for packaging.

** New file cob.pc, which is used by pkg-config script.

** libcob.conf is now installed under sysconfdir (i.e., $(PREFIX)/etc).
The default value of COB_CONFIG_FILE has been changed appropriately.

** The directory `tests' includes new testsuites.
"make check" will run the tests.

** We use db1 again instead of db2 or db3.

** New option -semi-fixed.

** New option -Wtrailing-line.

** CALL statements now accept CONTENT LENGTH OF clause.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.9.7

** The default value of COB_CONFIG_FILE has been changed to
"$PREFIX/etc/open-cobol/libcob.conf".

** SORT and MERGE statements have been impelemented.

** Preliminary implementation of SCREEN SECTION.

** Many bug fixes and improvements.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.9.6

** cobc now requires `-main' flag to build an executable from a COBOL file.

Without -main, cobc does not generate a main function.
See manual for details.

** Run-time configuration file: libcob.conf

The environment variable `COB_CONFIG_FILE' specifies the file name
(default: "${prefix}/share/open-cobol/libcob.conf").

** Use gettext for international messages.

** Include the test suite in subdir `testsuite'.

** Many bug fixes and improvements.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.9.5

** Support Berkeley DB 2.0.

** Many bug fixes.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.9.4

** OpenCOBOL now requires Berkeley DB 3.0 or later.

** File I/O routine (libcob/fileio.c) has been reimplemented.

** New NIST Test Suite modules: SM, IC, SQ, RL, IX.

** Many bug fixes.
