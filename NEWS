* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.20

** cobc now generates an executable without `-main' flag.

`-main' has been renamed to `-fmain', which is turned on
by default if none of -E, -C, -S, -c, or -m is given.

** Default source format is now fixed format.

Source format auto-detection is now disabled.
Instead, you can use SOURCE FORMAT compiler directive
as described below.  This conforms to the COBOL 2002
standard.

** Compiler directive "SOURCE FORMAT" is now supported.

Put the following line at the beginning of file if you
want to use the free-form:

  >>SOURCE FORMAT IS FREE

** Option `-semi-fixed' has been removed.

If you want to expand program text area into more than 72 columns,
use the new option `-column' instead.

** New option `-column', which specifies the end of program text area.

** New option `-T', which specifies the tab width.

** New option `-Wall', which enables all warning options.

** New option `-Wend-evaluate', which warns lacks of END-EVALUATE.

** New option `-Wend-if', which warns lacks of END-IF.

** New option `-Wparentheses', which warns lacks of parentheses
around AND within OR.

** New option `-Wcolumn-overflow', which warns any text after column 72.

** Option `debug' has been renamed to `-fdebugging-line'.

** USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL is now supported.

** Improved error checking.

** Additional testsuite entries.

** Bug fixes.

are used for packaging.

** New file cob.pc, which is used by pkg-config script.

** libcob.conf is now installed under sysconfdir (i.e., $(PREFIX)/etc).
The default value of COB_CONFIG_FILE has been changed appropriately.

** The directory `tests' includes new testsuites.
"make check" will run the tests.

** Preliminary implementation of SCREEN SECTION.

** Many bug fixes and improvements.


* Changes in OpenCOBOL 0.9.6

** cobc now requires `-main' flag to build an executable from a COBOL file.

Without -main, cobc does not generate a main function.
See manual for details.

** Run-time configuration file: libcob.conf

The environment variable `COB_CONFIG_FILE' specifies the file name
(default: "${prefix}/share/open-cobol/libcob.conf").

** Use gettext for international messages.

** Include the test suite in subdir `testsuite'.

** Many bug fixes and improvements.
