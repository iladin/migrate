If you are a developer, consider building the latest OpenCOBOL
from the CVS repository.

We use the following extra packages to build OpenCOBOL:

  o Autoconf 2.53
  o Automake 1.6.1
  o Libtool 1.4.2
  o Gettext 0.11.2
  o Bison 1.28
  o Flex 2.5.4

After installing these packages, edit (if needed) and run the
script `autogen.sh', which is in the CVS repository.  This
script executes the following commands one after another and
set up the configure script:

  gettextize
  libtoolize
  aclocal
  autoheader
  automake
  autoconf

Then, run the configure script with option --enable-maintainer-mode,
which enables some options that facilitates package maintenance and
development.
