If you are a developer, consider building the latest OpenCOBOL
from the CVS repository.

We use the following extra packages to build OpenCOBOL:

  o Autoconf 2.54
  o Automake 1.7
  o Libtool 1.4.2
  o gettext 0.11.5
  o Bison 1.28
  o Flex 2.5.4

When you modify configure.ac or Makefile.am, run autoreconf
to regenerate necessary files and commit them.

You might want to run your configure script with option
--enable-maintainer-mode during development so that running
make will automatically regenerate configure and so on.
